## âœ¨ **What Changes with Real API Key**

### **Before (Current Demo Mode)**
```
User: "Hello, could you take me to Suseong Lake?"
AI: "That's interesting. What else would you like to know?" (Generic fallback)

Voice Input: [Mock transcription]
Feedback: "Keep practicing! API not available."
```

### **After (With Real API Key)**
```
User: "Hello, could you take me to Suseong Lake?"
AI: "Of course! Suseong Lake is beautiful. That'll be about 15 minutes and cost around 8,000 won. Shall we go?" (Dynamic, contextual)

Voice Input: [Accurate Whisper transcription]
Feedback: "Great pronunciation of 'Suseong'! Try emphasizing the 'Lake' more clearly. Score: 85/100"
```

## ðŸ§ª **Test Real AI Integration**

# Volty Project Manager - Practical Usage Guide

## How to Actually Use This System

### Starting the Application
```bash
cd volty_project_manager/src
python volty_main.py
```

## Real Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Creating Your Smith Machine Alignment Project

1. **Launch the app** and go to **"Projects"** tab
2. **Click "New Project"** and name it "Smith Machine Bench Aligner"
3. **Open the project** - add description like:
   ```
   Ultrasonic sensor system to help align bench perfectly in center of Smith machine
   Target components: HC-SR04 x2, Arduino Uno, OLED display
   ```
4. **Go to "Code Templates"** tab
5. **Select**: Basic → Ultrasonic Sensor 
6. **Click "Load"** - you'll get working ultrasonic sensor code
7. **Modify the code** for dual sensors (left/right measurement)
8. **Save the code** as "smith_aligner.ino"

### Scenario 2: Testing Your Arduino Setup

1. **Connect your Arduino** to USB
2. **Go to "Arduino Scanner"** tab  
3. **Click "Refresh"** - see your Arduino port (e.g., COM3)
4. **Select the port** and click "Test Connection"
5. **Click "Send 'ping'"** to test if Arduino responds
6. If it works → **upload your code**
7. If not → **check cable, drivers, or try different baud rate**

### Scenario 3: Monitoring Your Equipment

1. **Go to "Equipment Monitor"** tab
2. **Check "Auto-monitor every 10 seconds"** 
3. **Open Fusion 360** → status shows "Running"
4. **Close Fusion 360** → status shows "Not running"
5. **Connect Arduino** → see port appear in real-time
6. Use this to **make sure everything is ready** before filming

### Scenario 4: Building Your Video Content

1. **Create project** for each video idea
2. **Use templates** to generate working Arduino code quickly
3. **Test everything** with the Arduino scanner
4. **Monitor equipment** to ensure Fusion 360 is running
5. **Document progress** in project descriptions
6. **Save all files** organized by project

## Practical Tips

### For Your YouTube Channel:
- **One project per video idea** (Smith Machine, Squat Guide, etc.)
- **Test hardware first** with Arduino scanner before filming
- **Use code templates** as starting points, modify for your needs
- **Keep notes** in project descriptions about what works/doesn't work

### Time-Saving Workflow:
1. **Morning**: Check equipment monitor, make sure everything's connected
2. **Planning**: Create new project, load relevant code template  
3. **Development**: Modify template code, test with scanner
4. **Testing**: Use port scanner to verify Arduino communication
5. **Filming**: Everything is tested and ready to demonstrate

### Real Hardware Integration:
- **Arduino Port Scanner**: Actually finds and tests your Arduino boards
- **Equipment Monitor**: Really detects if Fusion 360 is running  
- **Code Templates**: Actual working code you can upload immediately
- **Project Database**: Keeps track of everything you've tried

## What This System Does vs Doesn't Do

### ✅ What It Actually Does:
- Scans and finds real Arduino ports
- Tests serial communication with Arduino
- Detects if Fusion 360 is running
- Provides working Arduino code templates
- Manages project information in database
- Saves your code and project notes

### ❌ What It Doesn't Do:
- Automatic 3D printing (you still use Bambu Studio)
- Generate 3D models (you still use Fusion 360)
- Control printers remotely (use manufacturer software)
- Replace Arduino IDE (still need it for uploading)

## Next Steps for Your Channel

### Immediate Use:
1. **Create "Smith Machine Project"** and test the workflow
2. **Connect your Arduino** and verify scanner works
3. **Try the ultrasonic template** - modify for dual sensors
4. **Document everything** for your first video

### Future Expansion:
- Add more custom templates for your specific projects
- Use project database to track video performance vs complexity
- Build up library of tested, working code examples
- Document what hardware combinations work best

## Troubleshooting

### Arduino Not Detected:
- Check USB cable connection
- Install Arduino drivers if needed
- Try different USB port
- Check Device Manager for COM ports

### Fusion 360 Not Detected:
- Make sure Fusion 360 is actually running
- Check if process name matches (might need adjustment)
- Restart monitoring if needed

### Database Issues:
- Database file created automatically in ../data/
- If corrupted, delete volty_simple.db to reset
- All project data stored locally

This system gives you **practical tools** that actually work with your **real equipment** for your **actual video production workflow**.
